```

2. In the **root directory** of **this** project execute.

```

Done. At this point you are ready to have fun with your drone using javascript.

# How to use

Basic usage:
```
const Tello = require('tello.js')

const drone = Tello();

drone.connect(); // without arguments uses default ip and ports
drone.takeoff();
// cool stuff ...
drone.land();
drone.disconnect();
```

# List of functions

TODO

# IP address and ports config

In case the drone is not using the default IP address and ports you can change the parameters in the `drone.json` file in the root directory of this repository.

ℹ️ By default when the drone is initialized it broadcasts frames in BASE64 format to all clients connected to the default address `ws://localhost:3000`. You can change the address and port with the `drone.json` file in the `"videoServer"` section.

# WebSocket Server for control

In case you want to control the drone using WebSocket you can configure the parameters in the `server.json` file in the root directory of this repository.

ℹ️ For more details: [WebSocket Server (Control, Set and State)](docs/socket.md)
