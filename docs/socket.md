# WebSocket Server (Control, Set and State)

The WebSocket server to send control commands, set configurations and get the drone status by default uses the address `ws://localhost:3001`.

To send a single command that does not require arguments:
```
<COMMAND>
```

To send commands that require arguments, add the command at the beginning and separate the arguments by space ` `:
```
<COMAND> <ARG1> <ARG2> <ARG3>
```

It is also possible to send **raw commands** based on the format used by the SDK. For example to move the drone forward using `rc roll pitch throttle yaw`:
```
rc 0 50 0 0
```

> ⚠️ The use of **raw commands** is subject to the format used by the [Tello SDK](https://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/RoboMaster+TT/Tello_SDK_3.0_User_Guide_en.pdf)
